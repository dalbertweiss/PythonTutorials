    "# 1. Python frameworks for building neural networks <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"frameworks\"></a>\n",
    "In our first lecture we introduced different packages such as __numpy__, __pandas__ and __matplotlib__. When building and training neural networks, we usually take advantage of packages such as __tensorflow__ or __pytorch__ which already have the basic building blocks implemented. Here is a short reminder of the different packages used:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Tensorflow__ [[1]](https://www.tensorflow.org/): Tensorflow is a machine learning library developed by Google. In contrast to scikit-learn [[2]](https://scikit-image.org/) (library containing basic ML algorithms, data mining and preprocessing in image processing) where, Tensorflow is specially designed for the use in the area of deep learning and supports symbolic calculations and execution on graphics cards (GPUs) to accelerate computing.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "__Keras__ [[3]](https://keras.io/): Keras provides an easy-to-use and easy-to-learn API (application programming interface) for creating and training neural networks. It relies on Tensorflow or Theano as backend.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "__Pytorch__[[4]](https://pytorch.org/)[[5]](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/examples_autograd/tf_two_layer_net.html)[[6]](https://towardsdatascience.com/pytorch-for-deep-learning-a-quick-guide-for-starters-5b60d2dbb564): In industry, tensorflow is still the package of choice. However, in the last years, it has often been criticized for being difficult to debug, since it uses static computational graphs. Pytorch is a framework which was developed by Facebook and is based on the library _torch_. One of its advantages is that it uses dynamic computational graphs which allows for dynamic network changes as it being run, with little or no overhead.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "__Theano__ [[7]](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/)[[8]](https://machinelearningmastery.com/introduction-python-deep-learning-library-theano/): Theano is a compiler that executed mathematical expressions and is also heavily used for training neural networks. Since Theano belongs to the older packages it is not recommended.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "__Caffe__ [[9]](https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/): Models can be defined in a plain text file and are processed on command line. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment __tensorflow__ is still the most widely used deep learning framework used within python especially in industrial applications [[10]](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-framework-power-scores-2018-23607ddf297a?gi=fb13689f2184). Tensorflow 1.0 has long been the leading framework in deep learning applications. However, it was often criticized for being hard to debug and for it's syntax not to be as handy for programming. This has led to the rise of a high interest and popularity within the Python community for the framework __Pytorch__, introduced by Facebook and which we are going to use within our Python Tutorial. To get some more reasons why you should learn Pytorch instead of many other frameworks have a look at [[11]](https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/10-reasons-why-pytorch-is-the-deep-learning-framework-of-future-6788bd6b5cc2)[[12]](https://blog.paperspace.com/why-use-pytorch-deep-learning-framework/). <br>\n",
    "Just for your information: to work against it's downsides, Google introduced a new version of TensorFlow in 2019 also known as __TensorFlow 2.0__. Instead of using static operations in its previous version, code is now executed in eager mode allowing operations being executed immediately for each building block without building graphs. \n",

    "# 2. Review of theoretical concepts about neural networks <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"theory\"></a>\n",
    "Deep learning has been been around since the 1950s, for which Rosenblatt  was the first one to introduce the concept of a _perceptron_. \n",
    "A neural network is build from individual parts called _neurons_. Each unit is weighted with a certain number of inputs which can be described as a linear function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",

    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "$$<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"sum_weighted_inputs\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x_i$ and $w_i$ describe all the $i$ inputs and weights given to the _neuron_. Usually, a bias $b$ is added to influence the activation of the neuron. We can also describe this in matrix notation by giving this as a dot product of the two vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h = \\begin{equation*}\n",

    "\\end{equation*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards the weighted inputs are passed through an __activation function__ $f(\\cdot)$ to get a unit's output $y$. Inspired by the neurons in the brain, it can be seen as a gate which fires as soon as some kind of threshold is passed.\n",

    "### 2.1.1 AND Perceptron <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"and\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way of understanding the concept of neural networks and perceptrons as it's key element is by consider is as a __logical operation__. To get a better idea lets visualize this for an __AND__ operator consisting of two input neurons $x_1$ and $x_2$:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='img/Perceptron_AND.png' width = \"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "One the right sight the logical table is desplayed showing the an output is positive or negative. One the left hand sight you can see the perceptron containing the four different points to be separated. The decision boundary displayed above is what we are trying to determine. In this case a separation between the four points becomes quite evident as we can treat it as a classical __linear regression problem__. However, keep in mind that the complexity of most real-world scenarios can not be displayed by a linear function. This becomes more clear when we introduce the concept of backpropagation in multilayer neural networks. Both the input neurons $x_1$ and $x_2$ are multiplied by a weight $w_1$ and $w_2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both the weights $w_1$ and $w_2$ and bias term $b$ are usually unknown to us and are determined through optimization. \n",
    "However, when building your neural network, a good initialization of the weights and bias is required to get to your global optimum within a small amount of time [[13]](https://towardsdatascience.com/weight-initialization-techniques-in-neural-networks-26c649eb3b78). \n",

When choosing the step size (in machine learning also often well-known as our learning rate) too high we are very much likely to miss our global optimum. When choosing the step size too small, the training procedure takes very long and, therefore, shows a slow convergence to the global solution. Furthermore, it is very likely to get trapped within a local minima/maxima. In case of deep learning this is often referred as __Batch Gradient Decent__ where the optimization takes place based on the entire training dataset [[17]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04747.pdf).

However, one important assumption made is that both training and testing dataset are generated based on the same underlying probability distribution.

    "Within our constructor `__init__` we first define the layers of our neural net should have. In the above example we define four __fully connected layers__ `fc1`, `fc2`, `fc3` and `fc4`. For `self.fc1 = nn.Linear(784, 256)` we specify the filter size of our kernel by assigning the 784 input features and 256 output features. These 256 output features are afterwards passed to the next layer. This process is quite typically to do some kind of __feature reduction__. For a better understanding: the 784 features derive from the number of pixels which in our case are (28x28 pixels in length and width). Another argument that can be passed is the `bias` which was not considered within our above example [[30]](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#linear-layers). <br>\n",

Afterwards we define the criterion on which our optimisation should be based on. `NLLLoss()` computes the __negative log likelihood loss__. This is based on the assumption that you are trying to maximize the likelihood of choosing the optimal weights. When looking at a classification problem this is equivalent to the also well-known __cross entropy loss__ [[31]](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/difference-between-cross-entropy-loss-or-log-likelihood-loss/38816/2). \n",

However, there are many other optimizeres already available within __pytorch__ which can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html). For instance, an extension of the above mentionend gradient decent is the implementation of SGD (stochastic gradient decent) which picks a data point from the dataset at random during each iteration [[32]](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/reducing-loss/stochastic-gradient-descent). The optimization heavily depends on the __learning rate__ that is set beforehand. The learning rate describes the step to take during each iteration of the learning process and can take a value between 0 and 1. It is one of our other hyperparameters which has to finetuned. A low learning rate leads to a slow learning process but guarantees a good smooth convergence to your global optimum. To speed up the learning process one often increases the learning rate, however, this can lead that we are not able to converge. \n",

    "One problem when training a neural network is that some neurons tend to be more active than others. This leads to part of the network to end up with very large weights, while other parts show up only very small weights. We can therefore include something which is called __dropout__. For that we specify with what kind of probability with we are going to drop  specific neurons [[35]](http://jmlr.org/papers/volume15/srivastava14a.old/srivastava14a.pdf). This can be seen as some kind of randomness or noise given to the neural network and is normally used to reduce overfitting. <br>\n",
    "__Be careful though!__ However, when outputs of a layer are randomly subsampled, it leads to the \"thinning of the neural network\" [[36]](https://machinelearningmastery.com/dropout-for-regularizing-deep-neural-networks/). In other words, this means that the effective capacity shown in the figure is reduced. This the advantage, that usually a larger model is required (often coming with the cost of an increasing training dataset) at a higher training time [[37]](https://medium.com/@amarbudhiraja/https-medium-com-amarbudhiraja-learning-less-to-learn-better-dropout-in-deep-machine-learning-74334da4bfc5) [[38]](https://machinelearningmastery.com/dropout-for-regularizing-deep-neural-networks/).\n",

    "The above plot is a typical example of an overfitting where the training loss starts decreasing while the test loss starts to rise with increasing epoch size.<br>\n",

    "To allow a neural network to generalize well, it heavily depends not only on the number of training and testing samples but also on the \"population\" or \"diversity\" of the data. You can see data augmentation as some kind of way how to fool your neural network by artificially generating new unseen data. The dimension of this becomes more clear when you having a look at [[39]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.08864.pdf) where the change of a single pixel within one image can cause it to be assigned to a totally different class - or _vice versa_ in their case - can be used to improve the results by combining adversarial techniques. This use of __Adversial Neural Networks__ can be come a rising field within the last few years especially after the first introduction of Generative Adversial Networks (GANs) by Ian Goodfellow. To have a grasp of its power have a look at the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCKbRCUyop8) or his publication [[40]](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf).\n",
